<h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
<p>Write a program to read the number of rows ($r$) and columns ($c$) of a two-dimensional integer array, then read the array elements row by row.
Finally print the elements that are greater than all of its neighbors.
Note that an element can have at most $4$ neighbors.
If there are multiple such elements, print them in the order of row by row, column by column.</p>
<h2 id="limits">Limits</h2>
<p>Both $r$ and $c$ are no more than $100$.</p>
<h2 id="input-format">Input Format</h2>
<p>There are $r + 1$ lines in the input. The first line has $r$ and $c$. Each of the next $r$ lines has $c$ integers as a row in the matrix.</p>
<h2 id="output-format">Output Format</h2>
<p>There are $k$ lines in the output, where $k$ is the number of elelments that are larger than its neighbors.</p>
