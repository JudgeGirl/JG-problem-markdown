<h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
<p>Write a function to count the number of characters, the number of words, the number of tokens, and the number of lines in a given string.</p>
<p>A word is a set of consecutive letters. A token is defined as consecutive non-white space characters, where a white space is &#39; &#39;, &#39;\t&#39;, or &#39;\n&#39;. The number of lines is the number of &#39;\n&#39; in the string. Note that by this definition &quot;\n\nabc&quot; has two lines, not three.</p>
<p>The prototype of the function is as follows.</p>
<pre><code>void count(char *string, int *nchar, int *nword, int *ntokens, int *nline);
</code></pre><p>Note: some judgement functions, such as isupper(c), guarantee that they always returns 1 in Windows system when the condition is true. However, the C standard does not guarantee this behavior. Instead you should always check for &quot;not equal to 0&quot;, and use conditions like if(isupper(c)) or if(isupper(c)!=0) to get the correct result. This is the case in our judging system, so do not assume the return value is 1, instead you can only assume the result is non-zero, when the condition is true.</p>
