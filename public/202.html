<h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
<p>Write a program to calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two mixed fractions. You will be given two mixed fractions -- a b / c and e f / g. For example, if a is 1, b is 3, and c is 4, then you have 1.75. You can also represent negative number by a negative a, so if a is -1, b is 3, and c is 4, then the result is -1.75. For simplicity we assume that a and e are always non-zero, b and f are always non-negative, and c and g are always positive. Also b and c have to be simplified. For example, you cannot have a = 1, b = 6, and c = 8. Also when b or f is 0, c and g must be 1. We will be given an extra number d as the operator. If d is 0, 1, 2, 3 then the operation is addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively. Now given a, b, c, d, e, f, g, compute the final result as a mixed fraction h i / j.</p>
<h2 id="limits">Limits</h2>
<p>The ranges of numbers are as follow. a and e are non-zero and between -100 and 100 inclusively. b, and f are non-negative and no more than 100. c and g are positive and no more than 100. d is always between 0 and 3 inclusively.</p>
<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>a, b, c, d, e, f, g.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>The output follows the same rules as the input. You need to output h, i, and j in three lines.</p>
