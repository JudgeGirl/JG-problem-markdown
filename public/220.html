<pre><code>The Declaration of Independence was a
statement adopted by the Continental Congress
on July <span class="number">4</span>, <span class="number">1776</span>, which announced that the 
thirteen American colonies then at war with 
Great Britain regarded themselves <span class="keyword">as</span> independent
states, <span class="keyword">and</span> no longer a part of the British
Empire.  Written primarily by Mr. Thomas Jefferson
the Declaration was a formal explanation of why
Congress had voted on July <span class="number">2</span> to <span class="keyword">declare</span>
independence from Great Britain, more than a
year after the outbreak of the American
Revolutionary War.  The birthday of the United
States of America-Independence Day-is celebrated
on July <span class="number">4</span>, i.e., the day the wording of the
Declaration war approved by Congress.
