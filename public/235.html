<h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
<p>Write a program to simulate a pachinko. For this problem we will use a very simple pachinko.</p>
<p>There are N rows of pins in this pachinko. The i-th pin of a row is located between the i-th and (i-
1)-th pin in the previous row, as shown in the figure below. When a ball drops on a pin, it will go
either left or right. This probability varies from pin to pin. After hitting N pins, the ball will
fall into one of the N + 1 buckets. Now given all the probability distribution of pins, please
compute the probability of the ball falling into each of the N + 1 buckets.
The number of rows of pins N, is less than or equal to 15.</p>

<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input has the number of rows N. The next N(N+1)/2 line has two
integers a, b, that indicate the ratio of the probability that the ball will go left or right.
The probability ratio is given from top to the bottom, from left to the right.</p>
<p>a, b &gt;= 0, and it is garanteed that one of a, b &gt; 0.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Please output N + 1 lines -- each has a fractional number. The i-line has the probability of the ball
falling into the i-th bucket. Each line has a ratio q/p to indicate the probability.
Note that you need to simplify the q/p ratio ï¿½ you should output 1/2 instead of 2/4.</p>

<p>In order to prevent arithmetic overflow, you should reduce the denominator and numerator of each fractional number you use.</p>
