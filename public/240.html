<h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
<p>Given four different points on the plane, determine the shape of this polygon. There are several cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the length of the four sides are the same, and the four angles are right, then it is a square. For example, the polygon by $(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)$ is a square.</li>
<li>If the length of the four sides are the same, but the four angles are not right angle, then it is a diamond. For example, polygon by $(-2, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), (0, -1)$ is a diamond.</li>
<li>If the length of the four sides are not the same, but the four angles are right angle, then it is a rectangle. For example, polygon by $(0, 0), (0, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0)$ is a rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>The first line has the number of test data $n$. $n$ is at least 1 and at most 10.
Each of he next $n$ line has a test data. Each test data line has 8 integers for the four points.
The first two are the x and y coordinates of the first point, etc.</p>
<p>Since the difference between two x coordinates, or two y coordinates is bounded by 10000, you may assume that the computation can be safely done with int.</p>
<p>It is also guaranteed that there will be no three points in a straight line, and the quadrilateral is convex and unique. The four points may be given in any order.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Output the shape for each input line. You should output <code>square</code>, <code>diamond</code>, <code>rectangle</code> according to the definition above. If the polygon does not fit into any definition, output <code>other</code>.</p>
