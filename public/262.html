<h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
<p>Write a program to compute the maximum number of consecutive 1&#39;s in their binary representation. For example 7 has three consecutive 1&#39;s since its binary representation is 00000111. 25 has two because its binary representation is 00011001.</p>
<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>A set of positive integers no more than 2147483647, one per line. You must process them until EOF.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>The maximum number of consecutive 1&#39;s in the input, one per line.</p>
