<h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
<p>Write a program to find the area of the minimum rectangle (with edges parallel to the axes) to contain a set of points. For example, if you are given the following points (1, 1), (2, 3), (7, 6), (-2, 7), (-4, 20), (0, 0), (-3, -3), then the smallest retangle to contain all the points is the one that has two corners at (-4, -3) and (7, 20). You need to print its area, which is 253.</p>
<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>You must process all input until EOF. There will be no more than 100 points, and all computation can be done in int. All coordinates are between -10000 and 10000, and there will be at least one point.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>The final area.</p>
