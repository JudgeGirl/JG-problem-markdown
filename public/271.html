<h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
<p>Write a program to multiply two polynomials. We will represent a polynomial by a sequence of its coefficients. For example, we will use (1 2 3) to represent x^2 + 2x + 3, and (4 5 6 7) for 4 x^3 + 5 x^2 + 6x + 7.</p>
<h2 id="limits">Limits</h2>
<p>The number of coefficients in a polynomial is no more than 100. The coefficients are positive and no more than 100.</p>
<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>There are four lines in the input. The first line is a positive integer n, the number of coefficients of the first polynomial. The second line has n integers for the coefficients of the first polynomial. Similarly the third line and fourth line are for the second polynomial.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>The coefficients of the product of the two input polynomials.</p>
