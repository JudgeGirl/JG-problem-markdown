<h2 id="task-description">Task Description</h2>
<p>We define a palindrome as a sequence of at least one integer that reads the same either forward or backward. For example &quot;1 3 5 3 1&quot; and &quot;1 2 2 1&quot; are both palindromes. To the extreme case &quot;1&quot; is also a palindrome. We also define a double palindrome as the concatenation of two palindromes. For example &quot;1 3 5 3 1 1 2 2 1&quot; is a double palindrome. To the extreme case &quot;1 3 5 3 1 1&quot; is also a double palindromes. Now given a sequence of at least two integers, please find the longest double palindrome. If there are multiple longest double palindromes, print the one that appears last.</p>
<h2 id="limits">Limits</h2>
<p>The number of integers in the given sequence is no more than 100.</p>
<h2 id="input-format">Input Format</h2>
<p>There is one line in the input. The first line has the integers from which we want to find the longest double palindrome.</p>
<h2 id="output-format">Output Format</h2>
<p>There is one lines in the output. The first line has all the integers of the longest double palindrome. number of ways as in the description.</p>
