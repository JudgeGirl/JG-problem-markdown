## Task Description ##

Write a function to count the number of characters, the number of words, the number of tokens, and the number of lines in a given string.

A word is a set of consecutive letters. A token is defined as consecutive non-white space characters, where a white space is ' ', '\t', or '\n'. The number of lines is the number of '\n' in the string. Note that by this definition "\n\nabc" has two lines, not three.

The prototype of the function is as follows.

```
void count(char *string, int *nchar, int *nword, int *ntokens, int *nline);
```

Note: some judgement functions, such as isupper(c), guarantee that they always returns 1 in Windows system when the condition is true. However, the C standard does not guarantee this behavior. Instead you should always check for "not equal to 0", and use conditions like if(isupper(c)) or if(isupper(c)!=0) to get the correct result. This is the case in our judging system, so do not assume the return value is 1, instead you can only assume the result is non-zero, when the condition is true.

## Sample main.c ##

```
#include <stdio.h>
/* Your code will be here */
int main()
{
    int len, numChar, numWord, numTokens, numLine;
    char str[]="\tThis is Sample-Input string.\nHope this helps!\n\n";
    count(str, &numChar, &numWord, &numTokens, &numLine);
    printf("%s: %d %d %d %d\n", str, numChar, numWord, numTokens, numLine);
    return 0;
}
```

## Sample output for main.c ##

```
    This is Sample-Input string.
Hope this helps!
