## Task Description ##

Write a program to factorize a polynomial. We will be given a polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$, where all $a, b, c$ are all integers between -100000 and 100000. Now we want to factorize $f(x)$ as $(x + d)(x + e)(x + f)$, where $d$, $e$, and $f$ are all integers, and $d \le e \le f$.

## Input ##

A line containing $a$, $b$, and $c$.

## Output ##

A line containing $d$, $e$, and $f$.
