## Task Description ##

Given a set of positive integers, compute their least common multiplier. For example, if you are given 2, 3, 4, and 5, then the least common multiplier is 60, because 60 is the smallest multiplier of 2, 3, 4, and 5.

## Input ##

The input has a line of positive integers. You must process all integers in this line.

## Output ##

The output has the least common multiplier of input integers. Note that it is guaranteed that all the computation can be done in the range of int.

## Sample input ##
```
2 3 4 5
```

## Sample output ##
```
60
```

## Hint ##

It is easy to see that the product of the least common multiplier and the greatest common divisor of
two positive integers is the product of these two positive integers. For example, lcm(6, 15) x gcd(6, 15) = 30 x 3 = 6 x 15.
