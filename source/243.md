## Task Description ##

There is a w by d room with a lot of mirrors in it. All the mirrors are arranged as in the following figure.

There are also a lot of windows along the room. We label each window from 0 to 2(w+d) -1, where w and d are the width and the depth of the room respectively. Since all the mirrors are two-sided, when we look into window number 0, we will see the view of window number 8, and vice versa. Now given all the mirror positions, please compute the view for each window.
## Input ##

The first line of the input has w and d. Both w and d are positive and no more than 20. Each of the next d lines has w numbers, and a 1 indicates there is a mirror, and 0 otherwise.

## Output ##

The output has 2(w+d) numbers, which are the view of looking into windows from 0 to 2(w+d) - 1.
