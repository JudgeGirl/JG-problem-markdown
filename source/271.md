## Task Description ##

Write a program to multiply two polynomials. We will represent a polynomial by a sequence of its coefficients. For example, we will use (1 2 3) to represent x^2 + 2x + 3, and (4 5 6 7) for 4 x^3 + 5 x^2 + 6x + 7.

## Limits ##

The number of coefficients in a polynomial is no more than 100. The coefficients are positive and no more than 100.

## Input ##

There are four lines in the input. The first line is a positive integer n, the number of coefficients of the first polynomial. The second line has n integers for the coefficients of the first polynomial. Similarly the third line and fourth line are for the second polynomial.

## Output ##

The coefficients of the product of the two input polynomials.
