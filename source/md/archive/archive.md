## Exams in the week of 12/07 ##

The exams next week will still be about ** structure**, due to the very disappointing grades this week.  They will also be two hours because your coding speed is still, well, having room for improvement.

* 12/7 Monday, **10:00 - 12:00 a.m.**
* 12/8 Tuesday, **3:00 - 5:00 p.m.**

## Exams in the week of 11/30 ##

The exams next week will be about ** structure**. However, it will also involve string processing. The time will be 1.5 hour since the exams will be easy, and I need some extra time to cover structure.

* 11/30 Monday, **10:30 - 12:00 a.m.**
* 12/1 Tuesday, **3:30 - 5:00 p.m.**

## Task 234 Factorization ##

I have removed the outgoing dependency of task 234 factorization. If you are stuck here, you can ignore it and continue to tasks 203 and 204 now.

## Exams in the week of 10/12 ##

Due to very disappointing grades this week, I decide to stick with array and loop for one more week. That is, the exams next week will still be about arrays and loops. Also I will give lectures for how to solve the tasks given in the week of 10/05. 

* 10/12 Monday, 10:30 - 12:00 a.m.
* 10/13 Tuesday, 3:30 - 5:00 p.m.

## Exams in the week of 10/05 ##

Due to a large number of students are stuck in loop level and are not able to advance to function practice level, I decide to delay the exam on function. The new exam schedule will be as follows.

* 10/5 Monday, 11:00 - 12:00 a.m.
* 10/6 Tuesday, 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

The exam will NOT cover function。

## 小考成績計算 ##
