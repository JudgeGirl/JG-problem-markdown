## Problem description ##

Write a program to manage length. A length has three components -- yard, foot, and inch. A yard is 3 feet and a foot is 12 inches. We will use an array of length 3 to present a length. `length[0]` will be the yard, `length[1]` will be the foot, and `length[2]` will be the inch. All of them are non-negative integers. Now you need to implement the following three functions.

1. `void init(int length[3]);`
This function resets the length to 0.
2. `void add(int length[3], int i);`
This function adds i inches to length. Note that the final length should have inch between 0 and 11, and foot between 0 and 2.  
3. `void sum(int lengtha[3], int lengthb[3], int lengthc[3]);`
This function adds lengtha and lengthb and place the sum into lengthc. Note that the lengthc should have inch between 0 and 11, and foot between 0 and 2.
4. `void diff(int lengtha[3], int lengthb[3], int lengthc[3]);`
This function subtract lengthb from lengtha and place the different into lengthc. We guarantee that lengtha is no less than lessb. Note that the lengthc should have inch between 0 and 11, and foot between 0 and 2.

## Subtasks ##
