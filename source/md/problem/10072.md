## Problem Description ##

We are given a set of activities. Each activity has a starting time s and an ending time $e$. Both $s$ and e are positive integers and $s < e$. Two activities will not have the same starting item and the ending time. Now please select the maximum number of activities so that they do not overlap. Two activities overlap if the previous activity has an ending time larger than the starting time of the later activity.

```c
#ifndef _ACTIVITY_H
#define _ACTIVITY_H 

typedef struct activity {
    int start;
    int end;
} Activity;

int select(Activity activities[], int n);

#endif
```

Your implementation should return the maximum number of non-overlapping activities as the return value. In addition, if the `PRINT` symbol is defined your implementation also need to print the selected activities, in ascending ending time order.

## Subtasks ##

* 5pt. $n = 2$, and the flag `PRINT` is not specified.
* 10pt. $n = 3$, and the flag `PRINT` is not specified.
* 10pt. $n = 4$, and the flag `PRINT` is not specified.
* 20pt. $n$ is no more than 100, and the flag `PRINT` is not specified.
* 55pt. $n$ is very large so you need to use `qsort`, and if the the flag `PRINT` is specified you need to print the solutions after the number of selected activities, in ascending ending time order. If the flag `PRINT` is not specified then you only need to return the number of selected activities.

## Hints ##

First you need to sort the activities according to their ending time. Then you keep selecting the activity with the earliest ending time, then removing any activities that overlap with with the activity you just selected. You repeat the second step until no activities left.

## main.c (test) ##
```c
#include "activity.h"
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXN 262144
Activity A[MAXN];
int main() {
	int n, cases = 0;
	while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1) {
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			scanf("%d %d", &A[i].start, &A[i].end);
		int ret = select(A, n);
		printf("%d\n", ret);
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Both $\{\tau_{1}, \; \tau_{2}, \; \tau_{3}\}$ and $\{\tau_{1}, \; \tau_{2}, \; \tau_{5}\}$ are valid solutions.  Any solution that satisfies these criteria will be accepted.
