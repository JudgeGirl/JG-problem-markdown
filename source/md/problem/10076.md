## Problem Description ##

Given a set of odd positive integers and build a balanced see-saw. Imagine that we have a stick of length $n$, where $n$ is an odd number, and a set of $n$ positive integers. Now we support the stick in the middle and place the $n$ numbers along the stick evenly, and we have a see-saw. Now please place the numbers so that the see-saw is balanced.

Let us consider an example. Let $n$ be 5 and the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 1, and 5. If we place the numbers as 3, 1, 5, 3, 2 then the seesaw is balanced because $3 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 = 3 \times 1 + 2 \times 2$.

Another vaild solution is 2, 1, 3, 1 because $2w \times 2 + 1w \times 1 = 3w \times 1 + 1w \times 2$

## Subtasks ##

* 5pt. $n = 3$
* 10pt. $n = 5$
* 30pt. $n$ is no more than 9
* 55pt. $n$ is no more than 17

## Input Format ##
There are many cases in one input file. Please read the input file until the EOF.

For each case, there are two lines in each case. The first line  contains a number $n$ which means the number of the set of the positive integers. And then there are n numbers in the second line which means the set of the positive integers.

## Output Format ##
If the see-saw can be balanced, print one possible solution.

If the see-saw can not be balanced, print `N`.
