## Problem Description ##

The task is to start from a given cell, traverse every cell of an $n$ by $m$ matrix in a loop without duplication. For example, if $n = 2$ and $m = 2$ and we start from $(1, 0)$, then we can go from $(1, 0)$, to $(1, 1)$, to $(0, 1)$, to $(1, 1)$, then back to $(1, 0)$. For simplicity we assume that $m$ is always an **even** number.

## Subtasks ##

* 5pt. $m = 2$ and $n = 2$.
* 10pt. $m = 2$ and $n \geq 2$.
* 10pt. $m = 4$ and $n \geq 2$.
* 20pt. $m = 6$ and $n \geq 2$.
* 55pt. $m$ is no more than 500, and $2 \leq n \leq 512$.

## Hints ##

* For any matrix of even number of columns, we can start from $(0, 0)$, go up to $(0, m - 1)$, then go right to $(n - 1, m - 1)$, then do a snake-like zig-zag traversal back to $(1, 0)$, then go back to $(0, 0)$.

* Since we can go through all cells in a loop, then we only need to identify the given cell in this loop, then print all cells along the way in order.

## Input Format ##
There are many cases in one input file, please read it until EOF.

There are four numbers in one case.

The first two numbers means the size of the $n$ by $m$ matrix. The first number is $n$. The second number is $m$.

The last two numbers means the cell that you start from.
