## Task Description ##

Write a function to count the number of characters, the number of words, the number of tokens, and the number of lines in a given string.

A word is a set of consecutive letters. A token is defined as consecutive non-white space characters, where a white space is `' '`, `'\t'`, or `'\n'`. The number of lines is the number of `'\n'` in the string. Note that by this definition `"\n\nabc"` has two lines, not three.

The prototype of the function is as follows.
```c
void count(char *string, int *nchar, int *nword, int *ntokens, int *nline);
```

Note: some judgement functions, such as `isupper(c)`, guarantee that they always returns 1 in Windows system when the condition is true. However, the C standard does not guarantee this behavior. Instead you should always check for **"not equal to 0"**, and use conditions like `if(isupper(c))` or `if(isupper(c)!=0)` to get the correct result. This is the case in our judging system, so do not assume the return value is 1, instead you can only assume the result is non-zero, when the condition is true.

## Sample main.c ##
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "count.h"
int main()
{
    int len, numChar, numWord, numTokens, numLine;
    char str[]="\tThis is Sample-Input string.\nHope this helps!\n\n";
    count(str, &numChar, &numWord, &numTokens, &numLine);
    printf("%s: %d %d %d %d\n", str, numChar, numWord, numTokens, numLine);
    return 0;
}
```

## Sample output for main.c ##
```
    This is Sample-Input string.
Hope this helps!
