## Task Description ##

Write a program to simulate a pachinko. For this problem we will use a very simple pachinko.

There are $N$ rows of pins in this pachinko. The $i$-th pin of a row is located between the $i$-th and $(i-1)$-th pin in the previous row, as shown in the figure below. When a ball drops on a pin, it will go either left or right. This probability varies from pin to pin. After hitting N pins, the ball will 
fall into one of the $N + 1$ buckets. Now given all the probability distribution of pins, please compute the probability of the ball falling into each of the $N + 1$ buckets. 

* The number of rows of pins $N$, is less than or equal to $15$.

## Input ##

The first line of the input has the number of rows $N$. The next $N(N+1)/2$ line has two integers $a$, $b$, that indicate the ratio of the probability that the ball will go left or right. 
The probability ratio is given from top to the bottom, from left to the right. $a, b \ge 0$, and it is guaranteed that one of $a, b > 0$.

## Output ##

Please output $N + 1$ lines -- each has a fractional number. The $i$-line has the probability of the ball falling into the $i$-th bucket. Each line has a ratio $q/p$ to indicate the probability. Note that you need to simplify the $q/p$ ratio, you should output $1/2$ instead of $2/4$.

## Sample input ##
```
2
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
## Sample output ##
```
2/15
7/10
1/6
```
## Hint ##

In order to prevent arithmetic overflow, you should reduce the denominator and numerator of each fractional number you use.
