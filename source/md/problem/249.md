## Task Description ##

Write a program to determine the relation between two employees in a company. Every employee is described by a record like the following.

```
struct employee {
  int id;
  char first_name[32];
  char last_name[32];
  int boss_id;
};
```

The `id` is a unique identification number of an employee. The `first_name` and `last_name` are the names of an employee. The `boss_id` is the identification number of the boss of the employee. Two employees have one of the following relation.

* If an employee A can follow the "boss" relation to an employee to another employee B, then A is a subordinate of B, and B is a supervisor of A.
* If A and B have a common supervisor C, then A and B are colleague
* If none of the above is true, then A and B are unrelated.

## Input ##

The first line of the input is the number of employees $n$, which is no more than 32. The next $n$ lines are the information of the employees. The next line is the number of queries $m$. Each of the next $m$ has the names of two employees. Since m could be quite large so you must process a query once you read it. These two names will be different.

## Output ##

The output has $m$ lines. Each line indicates the relation between the two employees.
