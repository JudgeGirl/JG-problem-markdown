## Task Description ##

Write a program to read data from a file. Your program will open a file with binary read mode. (The file name is given in standard input.) The first four bytes of the file is a positive integer $n$, which is the number of data afterward. Then there are $n$ two byte signed integers ranging from -32768 to 32767 in binary format. Now you need to determine which number from -32768 to 32767 appears most. If there is a tie, report the largest one. For example, if both 1 and 10 appear 100 times, which is the maximum number of times, then you should report 10.

## Input ##

There is a string with maximum length 200, specifying the file name. This string can be read by `scanf("%s",...)`.

## Output ##

You should output two lines. First line is the number that appears most, and the second line is the frequency of this number.

## Sample Input ##
```
0.dat
```

## Sample Output ##
```
10
100
```
