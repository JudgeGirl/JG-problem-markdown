## Task Description ##
Given three rectangles whose sides are parallel to either x-axis or y-axis, please compute the area of the shape that is covered by at least one of these three rectangles. The three rectangles can overlap in any way you can imagine, however, this is as the same as computing the **union** of three sets.

## Input Format ##
There are 3 lines in the input data. In each line there are 4 integers $l, \; b, \; r, \; t$ representing a rectangle, where $(l, b)$ is the coordinate of the bottom-left vertex, and $(r, t)$ is the coordinate of the top-right vertex. The width and height of each rectangle are between $1$ and $20000$ respectively.

## Output Format ##

You should output the area specified above in a single line.

## Sample Input 1 ##
```
0 2 3 5
1 0 4 3
2 1 5 4
```
## Sample Output 1 ##
```
20
```
## Sample Input 2 ##
```
1 0 3 2
2 3 4 5
0 1 5 4
```
### Sample Output 2
```
19
```
### Hint 
Denote the cardinality of set $A$ as $|A|$, the union of sets $A$ and $B$ as $A+B$, and the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$ as $AB$, we have $|A+B+C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |AB| - |AC| - |BC| + |ABC|$.
