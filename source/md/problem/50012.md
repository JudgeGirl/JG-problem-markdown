## Problem Description ##

Write a block moving program. A block is a k by k square in a 8 by 8 grid. The grid has 8 rows (from 0 to 7, top to bottom) and eight columns (from 0 to 7, left to right). A 2 by 2 block with its upper left corner located at row 3 and column 2 is like this.

```
00000000
00000000
00000000
00110000
00110000
00000000
00000000
00000000
```

We can represent a block with an unsigned long long integer, which has 64 bits, therefore the block above can be represented as a binary number like this.

```
lowbit                                                   highbit
0         1         2         3         4         5         6
0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123
0000000000000000000000000011000000110000000000000000000000000000
```

**NOTE**: Here the left-top digit on the 8 by 8 grid is the lowest bit of the integer.

Now given a block as an unsigned 64 bit integer, you need to implement the following functions.

* `void printBlock(unsigned long long int *block);`  
Print a block as indictaed above.

* `void initialize(unsigned long long int *block, int row, int column, int size);`  
This function will initialize the block so that the left upper corner is located at (row, column), and with size size. For example, we can use `initilize(&block, 3, 2, 2)` to get the block in the previous example.

* `int moveLeft(unsigned long long int *block);`  
This function will move the block left by one column. For example, if we call `moveLeft(&block)` then the block will look like this.
```
00000000
00000000
00000000
01100000
01100000
00000000
00000000
00000000
```	

* `int moveRight(unsigned long long int *block);`
This function will move the block right by one column. For example, if we call moveRight(&block) then the block will look like this.
```
00000000
00000000
00000000
00011000
00011000
00000000
00000000
00000000
```

* `int moveUp(unsigned long long int *block);`
This function will move the block up by one row. For example, if we call moveUp(&block) then the block will look like this.
```
00000000
00000000
00110000
00110000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
```

* `int moveDown(unsigned long long int *block);`  
This function will move the block down by one row. For example, if we call moveDown(&block) then the block will look like this.
```
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00110000
00110000
00000000
00000000
```

Some moves may be invlaid. For example, if the block is on row 0 then it cannot be moved up, and if is at column 0 then it cannot be moved left. A move function should return 1 if the move is valid, and 0 if the move is invlaid. If the move is invlaid, the value of the blcok should **NOT** be changed.

## Source codes

### main.c ###
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "blockmover.h"

int main() {
    unsigned long long int num;
    char operation;
    int ret;

    scanf("%llu", &num);

    while (1) {
        ret = 1;

        scanf("%c", &operation);

        if (operation == 'p') {
            printBlock(&num);
            break;
        } else if (operation == 'u')
            ret = moveUp(&num);
        else if (operation == 'd')
            ret = moveDown(&num);
        else if (operation == 'l')
            ret = moveLeft(&num);
        else if (operation == 'r')
            ret = moveRight(&num);
        else if (operation == 'i') {
            int row, column, size;
            scanf("%d %d %d", &row, &column, &size);
            initialize(&num, row, column, size);
        }

        if (ret == 0)
            printf("Invalid move!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Technical Specification and Constraints ###

* 20pt. Implement ``printBlock``.
* 15pt. Implement ``printBlock``, ``moveLeft``, and ``moveRight``. All moves are valid.
* 20pt. Implement ``printBlock``, and all four move funnctions. All moves are valid.
* 30pt. Implement all four move and ``initilize`` functions. All moves are valid.
* 15pt. Implement all four move and ``initilize`` functions. Some moves may be invalid.

Except illegal moves, all other inputs are valid.

## Sample Inputs and Outputs ##

In input files, the first line is the initial value of ``block``. The following lines are actions. ``'l'`` means moving left, ``'u'`` means moving up, and so on. ``'i'`` means initilization. The three arguments of ``'i'`` command mean row, column and size. ``'p'`` prints the current block. Once ``'p'`` is called, the program ends.

## Hint ##
To initilize a 2 by 2 block we need to build the following pattern.
```
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000011
00000011
```
If we write it in binay it will become the following.
```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001100000011
```
To get this pattern we simply take the or of the following.
```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001100000000
```
The we can use moveUp and moveLeft to move the block into the correct position.

To detect the cases that we cannot move a block we need to detect whether the block is at row 0 or 7, or column 0, and 7, so we need the following four patterns.

It is easy to construct the first and second pattern, which is simply 255. In order to construc the fourth pattern, we consider its binary form.
```
0000000100000001000000010000000100000001000000010000000100000001
```
It is easy to see that it can be construicted by taking an "or" on the following.
```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
It is easy then to construct the third pattern from this.
