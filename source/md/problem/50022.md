## Problem Description ##

Read problems statements in <span class='tooltip'><span class='abbr'>Mandarin Chinese</span><span class='popup'>Morris AI 翻譯：<br/> 在 $m \times n$ 個盤面上恰好填入 $1$ 到 $mn$ 的所有數字，現在給與每一行、每一列的總和，請逆推回去得到原始盤面。如果盤面不只有一種，輸出任一種皆可，反之，無解盤面請輸出 **no solution** 一行。</span></a>

There is a $m$ by $n$ matrix consisting of integers from 1 to $mn$. You are given the sum of the rows and the sums of the columns, and please write a program to determine the number in each cell of the matrix. Consider the following example.

|R\C| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | $R[]$|
|---|---|---|---|---|------|
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  10  |
| 2 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |  26  |
| 3 | 9 | 10| 11| 12|  42  |
|$C[]$| 15 | 18 | 21 | 24 | none|

Now you are given $m = 3$, $n = 4$, and $10$, $26$, and $42$ as the sums of rows, and $15$, $18$, $21$ and $24$ as the sums of columns. The locations of all numbers will be as above. Your task is to print the numbers as a $m$ by $n$ matrix. If there are no solutions, print `no solution`.

## Subtasks ##

* 10pt. $n = 1$ or $m = 1$.
* 15pt. $m = n = 2$, and there is exacly one solution.
* 15pt. $m = n = 2$. and there could be no solution.
* 50pt. $m \times n \le 12$, and there could be no solution.
* 10pt. $m \times n \le 16$, and there could be no solution.
