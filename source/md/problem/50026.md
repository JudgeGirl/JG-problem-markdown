## Problem Description ##

Given the name of a file, count the numbers of lines, words, and bytes in it. A line is a sequence of characters that end with a new line `'\n'` or `EOF`. For example, if a file has `"abc\n9   9 "` then it has two lines -- `"9 9 "` is also a line since it ends with `EOF`. Another way to see it is that a line ends with `'\n'`. However, if a file does not end with `'\n'` and there exists at least one character between `EOF` and the last `'\n'`, then that is also a line. A line will not have more than 1024 characters (including the optional new line character).

A word is a sequence of letters. For example if a file has `"abc+def hhh\n"` then it has three words. A word will not have more than 1024 characters.

## Subtasks ##

* 5pt. The file has nothing.
* 10pt. The file has only letters.
* 10pt. The file has only letters and ends with a new line (`'\n'`).
* 20pt. The file has only letters at the beginning and ends with a sequence of new lines (`'\n'`s).
* 30pt. The file has letters, space, and newlines.
* 25pt. The file could have anything.

Anybody should be fine if it was just to ease loneliness
Because the stars in the night sky seems like falling, I cant lie to myself
One more time, please dont' change the season
One more time to the time when we fool around
