## Problem Description ##

Construct a binary tree in a level-by-level fashion. You will be given an array of n elements, and you will construct a tree with root having `array[0]` as the level, which has `array[1]` as it left child, and `array[2]` as its right child, and so on. Your function should return a pointer to the root of the constructed tree.

```
Node *construct(int array[], int n);
```

The definition of a Node is as follows.

### tree.h ###

```
#ifndef _TREE_H
#define _TREE_H

typedef struct Node {
    int label;
    struct Node *left, *right;
} Node;

Node* construct(int array[], int n);

#endif
```

## Subtasks ##
* 5pt. $n = 1$
* 5pt. $n = 2$
* 10pt. $n = 3$
* 30pt. $n$ is no more than $100$.
* 50pt. $n$ is no more than $1000$.

## Hint ##

It is easy to see that the left child of `array[i]` is `array[2 * i + 1]` and the right child is `array[2 * i + 2]`, so it is easy to construct the tree recursively.

## main.c (test) ##
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "tree.h"

void printAndFree(Node *u) {
	if (u == NULL)	return ;
	printf("%d ", u->label);
	printAndFree(u->left);
	printAndFree(u->right);
	free(u);
}

int main() {
	int A[32767], n;
	while (scanf("%d", &n) == 1 && n != 0) {
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			scanf("%d", &A[i]);
		Node *root = construct(A, n);
		printAndFree(root);
		puts("");
	}
	return 0;
}
```
