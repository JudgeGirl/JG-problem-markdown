## Task Description ##

Given the three coordinates of three vertices of a triangle, determine whether it is an isosceles triangle, an acute triangle, an obtuse triangle, or a right triangle. Here we assume that all coordinates are integers. Note that if an triangle is an isosceles triangle, you cannot report it as an acute triangle nor a right triangle. To avoid lose of accuracy it is strongly suggested that you compute the three squares of the length of sides, rather than to compute the length. Suppose the square of the longest side is $a^2$, then you can determine the shape of the triangle by comparing it with $b^2$ and $c^2$, which are the squares of the other two sides.

## Input format ##

The first line contains one integer, $n$, indicate the number of input cases below. The following are $n$ lines, each contains six integers, $x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3$, which are the three coordinates of three vertices of the triangle. Each integer is non-negative and less than 1,000. All the input datas will form a triangle correctly.

## Output format ##

For each case, print the type of the triangle, `isosceles`, `acute`, `obtuse`, or `right`.
