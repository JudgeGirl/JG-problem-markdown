<h2 class="content-subhead">Task Description</h2><p>Write a program to help a witch find out the correct composition of a secret lotion. The witch has three kinds of ingredients: alligator legs, bat eyes, and cat skulls, which we will refer to as $a$, $b$, and $c$. These three ingredients has three different levels of magic power, which we will refer to as $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively. If we put just the right amount of these ingredients together so that the sum of their magic power is exactly $D$, then we will be able to make the secret lotion. If we cannot put together just the right amount of magic power, we cannot make the lotion.</p>
<p>Now given the the amounts of $a$, $b$, and $c$, determine if the witch can make the lotion.</p>
<h2 class="content-subhead">Input</h2><p>Each input has $N$ input cases, which appears first in the input. The next $N$ lines each is an input case. Each input case is a line of 7 integers. The first number is the amount of magic power desired ($D$), and the next three numbers are the units of supply of the three ingredients the witch has $(a, b, c)$, and the last three numbers are the levels of magic power of these three ingredients $(A, B, C)$. All the numbers are non-negative integers and can be stored in <code>&quot;int&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2 class="content-subhead">Output</h2><p>The output has $N$ lines, each for a input case. If the witch is able to make the lotion using the supplies she has, please output <code>&quot;yes&quot;</code>, otherwise output <code>&quot;no&quot;</code>.</p>
